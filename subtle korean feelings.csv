LC1,"this is such a good question that ive thought about a lot im definitely not comfortable with my language skills rn b/c im not fluent. i know enough to get around in korea (which is not that hard) but my grammar is really bad. sometimes i dont feel korean enough b/c of the fact that im not fluent and i especially dont feel like a true korean when im around korean internationals. my korean has been made of in a variety of ways: people saying my korean is cute, that i have a big american accent, people being OVERLY impressed with how much i know almost in a condescending way, etc. i can speak comfortably to my parents b/c they understand i dont know much and they often praise me for knowing as much i know since ive never been to korea, never went to korean school, so i basically learned everything from my parents and tv shows/movies/songs. i feel comfortable speakin with my korean american friends who are also not rly fluent and we use a mix of korean and english, which is the most comfortable form of language for me. i definitely shut my mouth (in terms of speaking korean) around korean internationals or korean-americans who seem super korean. i rly wish i was fluent!! it would save me a lot of embarrassment esp when im in situations when i have to talk to elders"
DK,"this is a fab topic to bring up :) im taking a lil break from my essay researching ahah so ill share my experience briefly (lol not really) !!! I'm an ABK so born and raised in Australia and I am really lucky in the sense that I have retained my language skills in a way that is more 'advanced'. I can communicate fluently with my family and am comfortable talking, albeit not 100% like a native, with other elders about economic issues and political things as well. I was raised with grandparents in the house who immigrated here in the 80s and a mum who spoke to us both in korean and english (she did high school and university here). I went to korean school for about 4-5 years when I was in primary school and have gone to korea to see family once every 3/4 years. Despite having a pretty good grasp of the language I have to say, I only really identify myself as korean in terms of my ethnicity and partial cultural background. I had a really interesting experience recently where I attended a korean church in the uk (i was meant to be there for the duration of this year on exchange) and I found it a really mixed time making friends with the other korean students there. As most of them were students from korea doing their post grad/undergrad studies in the uk, I found I couldn't really relate to them with a lot of things. Humour, general interests, involvement within the university, types of friends etc. (Side note, mind you this is coming from someone who has attended korean church in australia their entire life). I think from the experience overall, I have realised more and more that gyopyoss are their own category. I am as Aussie as anyone else in my schooling and life experiences but obviously I have come from a background that is so different to a standard 'caucasian family'. I can communicate well, read, write okay and listen but my mannerisms, knowledge of slang, more complicated phrases expressed in dramas/reality tv will never be to the standard of a native (obviously). I tend to be more into western shows, music and have a very diverse group of mates so maybe in an alternative version of myself where I was more invested in korean culture I could weave my way into better suiting with native koreans. But I'm pretty happy with my cultural identity the way it is atm :)"
AS,"(I'm tired and will probably ramble on and talk in circles so I apologize in advance lol). I was born in Seoul but was adopted when I was 3 months old so I grew up white. My parents were always encouraging me to learn about Korea when I was younger but I really pushed it away, as is very common among the adoptee population. For a lot of us adoptees, we didn't grow up with any exposure to other Koreans (or any Asians or other minorities for that matter), and with even our families being non-Korean, it really puts a strain on the whole identity crisis, for a lack of better term; and I've found most adoptees try to assimilate into white American culture as much as possible. I really hated being Asian growing up, and it wasn't until my senior year of high school that I peaked interest. I taught myself how to read hangul and some basic phrases, but that was about it. In 2015-2016 I moved to Korea and spent some time doing language programs at a university, and then I did that again in 2018-2019. My language skills are definitely not what I consider fluent. But because I started taking language classes when I was 23 after never hearing any Korean in my life, I'm both proud of how much I've learned and also mad I'm not better since I lived there for 2 years and plan on moving back again this year lol. I'm still fairly comfortable with my current level (somewhere between high intermediate and low advanced), although not necessarily confident or content with my current level. I have no problem getting around, having conversations, etc., to the point that my most recent ex only spoke Korean, so it's no longer a HUGE issue, but I still am always concerned that my Korean isn't good enough, and that I'm not culturally Korean enough. Frankly, I've tried really hard to assimilate into Korean culture, with language-learning being a key factor, but I think a lot of this goes back to adoption, as I personally feel as an adoptee needing to prove myself, since I didn't even grow up in a Korean household."
LB,I am perfectly fluent in Korean but feels so awkward and weird speaking it. Formal speak to adults is fine but not with friends. It just feels so WEIRD
KO,"Not sure if I am the demographic you were looking for feedback from (I am half Korean Half Black). But I was raised in the states and raised in a Korean community. My Korean is pretty decent(when I go to Korea I can get around pretty easily and convey what I want to people) My first language was korean but my parents stopped speaking it in the house (just until I was out of ESL classes) once it was time for me to go to elementary school they realized I didnt actually know very much english __.When I visit my family in Korea we have pretty decent conversation but I do wish to improve my Korean. The conversations we have aren't as detailed or in depth as I would like because of my limited vocabulary. Of course when I go to Korea people overreact on How good my Korean is. Most people assume my cousins (half white and korean) speak korean (they dont) and look towards them when taking our orders or to talk to. Or they will talk about me in korean (good and bad things) then when I reply or talk to my mom in korean they look shocked or tell me how they didnt expect me to speak korean(which is understandble because I am mixed). I personally feel very Korean because I was raised in the Korean American community, did all the events, learned the korean drum, the fan dancing and only attended korean churches growing up(heck I was better at korean than most of the full blooded korean kids in the churches I attended growing up). The Korean community (in America and in korea) dont see me as korean;now that i am an adult trying to find a Korean community has been awful i I feel avoided and almost shunned for not looking full Korean and the Black community thinks I am too asian."
HL,"For me I was born in South Korea and grew up there until I was 7. And moved to Canada ever since. I think I'm decent in Korean. Both informal and formal but when I speak Korean, I sometimes enter english there and there. When I speak with strangers I weirdly cannot speak Korean. I hesitate a lot. But with someone I'm comfortable with I can speak it fine. I can also read but writing takes effort. I asked my Korean older female friends in college about my Korean skills and whether or not I am allowed to put fluent in Korean as my set of skills in my resume and all of them have told me my Korean is really good and I am fluent. But hence this, I still don't feel Korean among other Koreans. I feel more Korean Canadian just because I'm more comfortable with English and that I am white washed. But with my non Korean friends I feel very Korean due to manners and my food preference. Idk if this helped or not. But this is my answer. But again I lived with a Korean who happens to just came to Canada with absolute no english skills for a month and it was harder for me to have a conversation with her just because like i mentioned I like to say certain words in english for words I dont know in Korean. And because she had no English skills we have to use google a lot for us to truly understand each other."
YK,Great question! For me I was born and raised in Bolivia and my first language is actually Spanish lol and I speak Spanish with my parents. I visited Korea once every 3-4 years but every time I dreaded going because I couldnt make friends and always had to listen to adults complain to my parents that I couldnt speak Korean. Later on I decided to join the Korean military in order to you know go back to the roots and it was a great experience starting on day one when they told everyone to stand by height but I didnt understand so I ended up with guys a head taller than me. all the officers thought I was dumb until I explained or at least me trying to explain conveyed that I didnt know Korean. After that whole ordeal my Korean exponentially improved but I am not confident enough to call it fluent. Also theres a show here where they show non Korean background foreigners speaking better Korean than I do and it does not help my confidence lol. For those who read until here stay strong my people and keep on learning Korean well get there. Theres no shame in trying to become better.
AO,"I was born and raised in America, but my first language is Korean. I am fluent in Korean (fortunately - I guess? - my parents had limited English ability when I was born; thus the forced Korean learning haha) and when I go around Korea, Im very capable of getting around. A lot of people are surprised that I had never lived/gone to school in Korea. I think Im equally comfortable with Korean and English but with more complicated, nuanced, advanced topics I prefer English. But weirdly enough, I have a slight Korean (barely noticeable) accent when I speak English and slight English accent (also barely noticeable) in my Korean. Speaking in Korean is pretty natural for me when I speak to elders or people in Korea (no matter the age). But in America I get extremely confused and awkward with speaking korean with people my age, younger, and especially to people who are older than me but not yet older women or older men. Its mostly about whether I should use formal speak especially when I am kind of close to them but also not really. I use formal speak with my parents mostly and to evident elders (aunts and uncles). As for my identity, I do identify more as Korean than Korean-American, but I cant deny the fact that I have Western traits. This makes me particularly self-conscious when I speak to strangers in Korean in Korea or in America to people who are completely native speakers. Its kind of a fear factor that comes in - like imposter syndrome. I try my best to blend in with ppl my age in Korea as much as possible, but there are obviously differences. Funny enough, even though I speak like a native speaker, I always feel like Im always lacking even though thats a natural phenomenon since Ive never lived or been educated in Korea."
MK,"Ive never been fluent in reading and writing but Ive been getting better as Ive been stuck in Korea due to COVID19. I was born and raised in a predominantly Korean area in America, so Ive always had the culture present in my life. But I never managed to pick up the language as well as my peers because I slacked off in Korean school and only used English outside of my house. But since Id always use Korean with my mom, I THOUGHT I was fluent in at least speaking it... yeah I was foolish to believe that talking with your mom vs people your age in full on korean is completely different and I failed to realize that lol. Ended up working with all native Koreans at a restaurant for a couple months... hardest thing ever because I could not understand what a lot of my coworkers said.. Ive never even experienced the work culture before so that was an even harder adjustment because Americans tend to be more social and less rigid in work environments.. definitely got yelled at and a lot of trouble. I think the hardest part was always being questioned about being Korean by my bosses almost everyday due to lack of language skills and social cues.. they never skipped a beat with that made sure I knew I wasnt Korean enough in their eyes.. Definitely sucked because suddenly it felt like I needed approval for being Korean?? At the end of the day, I knew I was Korean and thats all that matters. Just cause were born and raised elsewhere, doesnt change the fact its in our blood also the further away I go from Seoul and the more I go around by myself, the more I get asked where Im from or if Im a disaporic kid? My diasporic accent apparently THICC but my Korean is still somehow really good compared to other diasporic kids?? Dont know how that makes sense but I think theyre just trying to be nice so Ím not offended"
HM,"My mom is Korean and my dad is Thai, so they raised me in Thailand. I was fluent in spoken and written Korean until sixth grade, when I stopped speaking Korean in school. I felt like such an outsider because we didn't have a lot of Korean kids in my school, so I guess I actively suppressed that part of my identity when I was outside my house. It didn't help that sixth grade is when my parents pulled me out of Korean Sunday school because the school moved to a location that was too far. I would also travel to see my Korean family once a year, which was enough to retain my ability to read and listen to the language, but it wasn't enough for me to retain my speaking abilities. Presently, I can understand most of what I hear and read, but I primarily think in English so it's hard for me to translate myself in my head before I speak, which is why I can understand what people say but have a hard time figuring out the words when I need to say them myself. I've embraced my Korean identity internally and I'm really proud to be a part of the Korean community, but my language skills and the fact that I didn't grow up in a predominantly culturally Korean household have made me uncomfortable when trying to assimilate with the Korean community in the states. Like I still feel out of place and I still feel like I don't belong when I'm amongst Korean Americans, but I know a lot of this is something I feel on the inside and not necessarily reflective of how other Korean Americans perceive me"
AK,"Im fluent in Korean as I lived there for 10 years during middle and high school (before I was born in the States and stayed there), after that I went to the states for university. As Im graduating now, I do notice how I feel awkward in just trying to speak it, not to mention the grammar and vocab loss lol. I didnt hang out with a lot of Koreans so I mainly used English which was my first language!"
EK,I consider myself to be more fluent in Korean than English but peeps have told me that I sound like Jay Park when I speak Korean so now I consider myself being fluent in 0 language lol
NJ,"Being half Korean, half Indian and born in Australia, my mum tried to get me to go to Korean school, but being a 4/5 year old, my priorities were quite different and my parents really didnt push too hard for it. I did get privately tutored but that only got me as far as knowing the alphabet and some basic words like grapes and hippo. Then about 4 years ago, I tried out 2 different Korean schools, where in the first school, the teacher gave my mum a lot of attitude for me not knowing Korean and where the second one, they were covering grammar way above my knowledge so it was pretty much wasted. Ive started again now where I can sorta navigate through some of the grammar"
QG,"im second gen, i grew up with my parents and grandparents so a lot of korean was spoken, it was my first language and i didnt learn english until i went to school. but at a certain point my korean didnt get better only my english did so i was speaking at a maybe higher elementary level of korean until 7th-8th grade bc i honeslty didnt care that much. i picked it back up in high school and its really awkward for me to have full conversations to adults besides my family and even to my friends that speak korean. not bc i dont know how to but im just not used to it ig. but now the only person i talk to in korean constantly is my mom and she is good and english as well so i find myself speaking a lot of konglish idk what the point is but i do want to get better at Korean. oh yeah i learned korean from Korean school when i was little but it was only like basics so i know no grammar rules i just figure it out as i go"
OM,"Was born in Korea, but after the first semester in Korea, I moved out to Saipan (iykyk kinda location). I remember not knowing a single word of English when I got there. My parents really kinda just said, here you go immerse yourself. And I picked up English pretty fast, but my parents didnt really learn any complicated English, so I just spoke Korean at home and English outside and with siblings. So Im pretty much fluent both sides, except my Korean has an accent according to my dad, (lmao hes pretty nit-picky) and where ever I go older Korean people would be so impressed with my Korean skills. Alot of us foreign Korean kids go to Korean school, but I hated it so we just studied at home instead."
HJ,"Was born in korea cant speak korean ended up working there in their government cos Im good at finding people, finished not speaking korean 7 years later and worked designing 1/3 of Netflix koreas titles without speaking korean, then quit"
MS1,"I was born in New Zealand and raised in the States. My parents are both Korean. My first language was Korean and although I speak better English than Korean now, I feel like Im not really that good at either. Idk how to describe it but I obviously know more English but there are a lot of words/expressions that I just wasnt exposed to that seem like common sense for most Americans (I.e. I didnt know what the bill of a baseball hat was). My Korean vocabulary is that of a elementary school student lmfao. I can communicate well and I can understand it better than I can speak it. Sometimes, I dont feel like I belong to either identity because there so conflicting and I was raised in both. When I talk to my parents, Im comfortable because they know what Im saying. I didnt grow up with other Koreans so idk about talking to other Koreans."
AM1,"I'm half Korean half Australian, born in Australia. My parents made the decision to only speak to me in English, even though my Korean mother's English skills are very poor. I took a couple of Korean language classes at uni, only enough to read. I lived in Korea for a year but didn't actively speak Korean. I don't speak Korean at all with my mum, but understand very basic conversations and can read at a basic level. I hate not being able to have deep conversations with my mum or being able to speak to my cousins. Along with the identity-crisis that comes with being always half-something and more or less having to justify my existence to people because I look different, I regret my language skills aren't better. I know a lot of it is my fault for not being diligent enough to study harder."
JY,"If I didnt end up living in Korea for 5 years, when i was 10, I probably wouldn't be comfortable with communicating with my parents at all and I probably would feel more comfortable with English speaking Koreans. Currently I am fluent enough to hold a conversation, but not so fond with few words, like living expenses, economy, life style words(I think that's what they're called)"
JS,"My father was told by my American kindergarten teacher that I didnt know enough English and I may fall behind my peers due to it. Panicked, my dad switched all my private study materials to English only. My mom was not supportive of the move but it was too late. By middle school my korean got pretty bad. My English is amazing and my korean is nearly non-existent these days. I can understand conversational korean and can read it phonetically but have a hard time speaking it. I have a ton of regret not being a more studious and serious Saturday korean school student. Ive lost opportunities due to not being bilingual."
YO,Was born and raised in Seoul for 18 years and I'm still shit at Korean
ES1,"Born in America, but I speak Korean with my mom and grandma daily. Practice is key!"
JK,"I was born and raised here. Only been to Korea twice. The last time was 15-16 years ago. Definitely not fluent. Scared to go to Korea alone since I'm not fluent and don't really know much about Korean cult tbh. I've lived in areas where the Korean community were small so there was no Korean school. My parents speak and understand both so I just naturally leaned to speaking English with them. I speak English with my siblings. I understand basic Korean but anything complex about scandals or politics, I'm kinda lost."
KC,"My mom never taught me beyond a couple of words, my dad speaks Japanese. I taught myself to read the language when I was 14, and I spent a couple summers with my family in Korea but I never picked up enough to hold a conversation. I can recognize a few words but thats it. Im still trying to teach myself but languages are not my strong point. I carry a lot of resentment towards my parents for not teaching me their languages or their culture. They tried to assimilate as best they could when they moved to the US and as a result, I know nothing about things like the new year or any of the holidays or birthday rituals and it sucks."
ES2,"i was born in Korea but moved to the states when I was 7. my mom brought a lot of korean books for me to read and i read all of them. (i think that really helped with reading and writing) As for speaking, my siblings and I had no choice but to speak in korean to our parents because they cant really speak english. So I was always fluent but not all that comfortable. but i think practice is KEY because once I went to college, I became the closest friends with international students and being around them, I always spoke korean. I also picked up in a lot more slang and started speaking more naturally. Also, texting my friends in korean has also helped me get faster at it and much better at spelling. My parents get surprised every time I come home because it always improves every semester now im comfortable enough to say Im completely fluent in speaking reading & writing!!"
SJ,"I was born and raised in NYC and I speak and write fluent Korean. My parents being immigrants only spoke to me in Korean as I was growing up, which made me perfect for ESL until 2nd grade! I am very grateful that I can speak/write in Korean now that I am older, but when I was younger, it was annoying having to go to Korean school on Saturdays (classic). It was also odd to be held as a standard by other Korean adults, as they would often be impressed that I could speak Korean although I was raised in NY... it made my friends feel defeated and perhaps that was when I felt insecure about speaking in Korean. Moving to a new part of Queens from middle school was a little hard because we were raised in a predominantly Asian population. This move to a non-Asian community, made me become a translator for my parents because important school documents were never translated in Korean (whereas previously that wasn't an issue). It was a little hard trying to fit in, but I found myself accepting my differences in high school as I hung out with friends from multi ethnic backgrounds. Sometimes, I still feel bothered to have to translate for my parents, but I'm recognizing what a privilege it is to be bilingual. Languages are beautiful and being able to communicate is a blessing in itself! When I travel to Korea, it is special being able to speak to my relatives, knowing what/how to order, and overall having an easy way of getting around! Kudos to my parents for being immigrants. I personally cannot imagine packing up and leaving to another country as they have.. makes me grateful and shifts my perspective."
PL,Look up TCK (third culture kid) if you havent already! Born and raised in the states away from any other Asians (personaly rejecting my Korean culture outside of the house) but grew up living with the grandparents speaking only Korean in the house. Moved to Socal in middle school with a ton of Asians and started using Korean outside of the house a lot/ started learning about the culture more by making friends with the fobs. I speak with a heavy Gyeongsangdo saturi so most koreans think I'm from Korea and they're surprised when I speak English. The older I get the more Im comfortable not identifying myself as Korean or American but as a Korean-American. English is by far more comfortable and natural but I don't really have any problem switching.
KJ,I was born and raised in Massachusetts. My parents spoke Korean to me so my first language was actually Korean and I couldn't speak English until kindergarten. I also went to Korean school every Saturday from age 3 to 18 lol. I'd say my Korean speaking ability is intermediate to advanced but it can get tough because I don't speak Korean with anyone else except my parents. I actually traveled to Korea last October and was super nervous because I feel like I have a very obvious American accent? But apparently I was paranoid since Koreans didn't realize I was American. I'd like to improve though so I can feel more comfortable expressing myself in Korean because sometimes I don't think my personality comes out when speaking Korean vs English.
RK1,"hihi, also not totally fluent but comfortable speaking if prompted and good enough for daily life in korea (conversational). i grew up speaking pretty minimal korean- just when i visited grandparents and whenever my mom wanted to trash talk someone in public/talk to just me when she volunteered at school. Never got to go to korean school since it was on saturdays when we went to church :( My best friend started helping me learn in middle school and through high school- a lot of my basic proficiency came from her. Then through university i continued to take courses, ultimately spending a year in korea for study abroad. Before i went abroad, i still was BARELY functional in korean- like very very basic understanding- in korea is where I really improved, and became comfortable speaking it (for the most part) regardless of the mistakes i often make. I will say, overcoming that confidence barrier was huge in improving my korean, as all my non-korean peers on the program with me would come running when they had trouble, and really forced me to use my korean even when i wasnt confident in my fluency. I still took courses after that and even learned some hanja, but a lot of that was political jargon so idr remember a lot of it now. My koreans def gotten worse since then, but my boyfriend, boyfriends parents and my grandparents have been helping me a lot, so super grateful for that. I dont think ill ever be business fluent tbh, but i really came to realize that i want my kids to be given the gift of being bilingual-- i feel like so many kids growing up bilingual dont understand how hard it is to obtain fluency in another language when you werent really given that opportunity as a child, and so ive gotten a lot of shit (mostly from diasporic males oddly enough) making fun of my korean when it was really like 90% my own effort as an adult trying to learn korean ://"
RK2,"I was born in canada, my dad immigrated here with my grandma when he was young so he spoke english to me while I grew up. My mom is korean but she made the effort to use english to me and my brothers, but used korean words for things like laundry and dishes. I grew up with the barely hearing korean language. I was motivated in high school by my second gen chinese and vietnamese friends to try and learn the basics, while being introduced to korean dramas and music. I've been working hard to learn on apps and forcing myself to speak to random people only in korean (glad we have language apps these days) to actually enhance my speaking and listening skills. Learned to type after dating a korean :) I'm still rough but I'd say my hard work paid off and my speaking is about intermediate"
MM,"1. Am I comfortable with my Korean language skills right now? Id say Im comfortable with where I am, knowing that Im always keen to broaden my vocabulary and get better at honourifics. 2. Do I feel like I either belong or do not belong to a Korean identity because of my language skills right now? This is a difficult question for me. Having a dual cultural identity, with a Korean mum, has always made it harder for me to feel like I belong. At Korean church I was the only mixed Korean kid, and even being a fluent 4/5 year old left me on the outskirts (socially). Language never felt like it made me belong because I dont look ethnically Korean; but language was definitely a useful tool/mechanism that aided me in feeling more connected to my Korean side. This is something I am extremely grateful for, because I think I wouldve felt even more othered if I hadnt been able to speak it fluently.  3. How do I feel when speaking to others in Korea? It feels really fucking weird. Again, because I dont ethnically look Korean, people are almost always shocked that Im able to converse with them, or understand what theyre saying. Theres this look of absolute disbelief when you order food or tickets or say something in Korean, I presume because of the assumptions theyve made about my physical features immediately others me as an outsider. In those moments I feel a mixed sense of pride, followed by validation that my Korean is good, then I feel quite sad that this would never happen to ethnically looking Koreans who grew up outside of Korea. Instead of being praised for speaking the best Korean they can, theyre held to a higher language standard because they just look like they should be fluent. Whereas I seem to never face criticism, but only praise for speaking my mothers tongue. Speaking to family or family friends in Korea is also weird. SO many times people will talk to me through my mum - ask her questions about me, like what am I studying, expecting me to not understand. Its really weird and it makes me feel the need to prove myself through fluency of Korean to them. Like I have to justify that I do belong because I can speak the language. This happens to close family friends too, ones I known since I was born. They ask me questions in English, and I respond, confused, in Korean, and weirdly they just continue to speak to me in English, even though they clearly prefer Korean. I think my experiences are extremely different to those ethnically Korean passing diasporic kids. Being mixed race, fluent in Korean person has definitely had its pros and cons. Even though I constantly feel othered, I feel that I gain acceptance in the community through my language use. I cant imagine how hard it must be for other mixed kids, who already feel like outsiders to both groups (Asian people see us as white and white people see us as Asian), who dont speak both languages of their cultures."
LC2,"Hey I'm mixed as well (Mum is korean). I feel the exact same with everything you mentioned. I think it's cool too that there are other half Koreans out there that can speak korean (even if it's not 100% fluent). One thing that is really awkward for me: When I go to Korean restaurants etc (There are a lot of koreans on working holiday where I live), I want to order and say thank you etc in Korean because when I see korean people it feels normal and comfortable as I grew up meeting and speaking with Koreans. Even though I am only half, I still feel korean. I don't feel like I'm more one race than the other (I feel Australian and I feel korean). But I think that if I were to do that they might think that I'm just trying to show off or think it's really weird because they won't know that I'm korean because I don't look like it. I have done it a few times before and they get really shocked and surprised and tell me I'm good at korean which is cute but it's so awkward haha"
JH,"Aussie born and raised. Went to Korean school as well as speaking w grandparents and parents, so I would say my speaking skills are somewhat proficient. Also working at a Korean restaurant has let me hone my Korean language skills with coworkers and customers. I'm proud to be a korean aussie but I guess I lack in spelling and grammar..."
RS,"Yup, born, half raised, full shit"
EP1,Full korean born and raised in america. Ive heard my korean is decent but even then my words come out jumbled and pronunciation sucks sometimes. Sometimes I cant even English so I feel like I dont belong anywhere.
SK,"I was born and grew up in Oregon! I had one other asian peer in my small town, so I obviously didn't have anyone to speak Korean with besides my family. I think like most second gen kids I can understand conversational Korean but it's hard to speak it. In college I started attending a Korean church, but eventually stopped going because there were cultural differences that were honestly too difficult to get over. They were all really kind to me but I couldn't ever understand what the pastor was saying and the Korean American vs Korean Korean showed me how different I am culturally to them. But it was helpful to meet an unnie there who wanted to improve her english so we helped each other! Definitely want to learn how to speak Korean more fluently so that my kids will grow up with a better understanding of their heritage."
AM2,"Man, I was adopted from korea, so i didnt really know about alot of the customs."
JMK,I was born and raised in California. Went to Korean school for like half a year then dropped it. Parents both speak heavy informal southern dialect which I inherited. I only spoke informal with my parents so I get nervous trying to speak in proper formal korean. My English sucks too so I aint got a homeland
JM,"I'm a lot less comfortable with my language skills now that I've moved out of the house and am not surrounded by my mom and her friends, but I am lucky enough to work at small Korean restaurant run by a Korean family who speaks to me in Korean and encourages me to learn more. I grew up speaking it but mostly with my mom so it's been a little harder for me to communicate but I'm getting there. Being half Korean and looking pretty white people don't usually expect me to understand/speak Korean so speaking it makes me feel more Korean, but then I realize how bad my Korean is and I feel a little less Korean if that makes sense. Although I feel very Korean on the inside, it's hard to explain and speaking the language is one of the best ways I can express it (outside of food)."
MS2,"I am resigned. As mentioned before, I spoke Korean until age 4 when I entered the school system and was systematically discouraged / punished, by both parents and teachers, from speaking Korean. I am now psychologically inhibited from speaking it. It is what is it. The 60's and 70's were vastly different times and I'm so glad to see how empowered the younger generation are in their Korean-ness. My daughter is half but she is SO PROUD of her Korean heritage - the food, the music, the YouTube influencers...... she doesn't speak or read the language but she might decide to tackle it later in her life."
HAM,"Born and Raised in the USA, I only speak Korean to my dad and my grandparents. My mother moved here when she was about 11 and my father came to the states in his 20s. They met here. My mother being partly raised in Korea and in america she was fluent in both languages and cultures. My dad ran the business most 9 times out of 10 so I only saw him before bed. My mother spoke english to me most of the time except when scolding or yelling or being upset with me. I can speak decently and fluent enough with my family but I don't feel comfortable enough to speak it to other Koreans. Also being raised as the only child and no cousins and also not around other korean people, I find it real difficult and kind of irritating to use honorifics with someone who is older than me by 1 to 4 years or whatever it consists of."
SP,"I grew up in Tennessee and my folks specifically did not want me to learn Korean. as immigrants who went through a lot of racism, language based discrimination and micro aggressions they wanted me to be better at English than a typical white American. Ive learned a bit of Korean here and there and studied it some in college, but whenever I start to feel bad about not knowing korean, I remind myself that I speak english better than a lot of kids I grew up around. I think the way I speak and communicate my thoughts has helped me get jobs and effectively network, although I do still want to learn Korean. Actually, I speak Mandarin because my high school offered it and I continued in college. my chinese is better than korean. I guess its cause everyone down south already assumes I'm chinese so might as well take advantage of it."
HK,"I was born in Minnesota, and moved around every 3 years. I even moved to Korea for 2/3 years in middle school. Good news was my Korean massively improved during that time. Bad news, I'm 31 and my Korean is stuck in middle school. Definitely a sore spot and whenever I go back to Korea, i feel like a child trying to communicate with my relatives, store owners, and waiters in Korea. I look Korean-ish, but with an American build, haircut, clothing style. So they know I'm not from Korea. I'm so self conscious speaking Korean, that even when I am around Koreans who speak more fluently than I do in the US, I almost dont even try so as to not appear foolish."
NK,"I'm a 3rd gen, born and raised in LA. My dad speaks little Korean (his accent is arguably as bad as non-Korean, Korean language learners) and my mom is fluent but definitely speaks more old school since shes been far removed from the new slangs/linguistic changes of Korean as she only knows what older Koreans taught her. I'm the oldest of 5 and our Korean language abilities range from semi-fluent/conversational to no Korean whatsoever. My parents/grandparents raised me with Korean as my first language (I would even spend summers in ktown with my grandma) but after going to school I stopped and my parents just spoke English. Growing up and even until college I didnt feel comfortable speaking Korean because I didnt feel like I was good. So I focused more on learning Spanish and Japanese because at least I had a foreigner pass if I made a mistake. I went to Korea for the first time for a weekend at 23 (I was studying in Japan) and was so scared of being judged for my Korean (I never learned to speak formally) that I ended up using Japanese/English most of the time but Ive definitely found more confidence recently with the encouragement of my friends in/from Korea that I'm better than I think. I used to be so against saying Im a Korean American and would tell people Im just American, but the Korean school bullies that told me I was dumb because my Korean wasnt as good as them dont have any influence over me anymore. Now my youngest sister is learning Korean for the first time at 17 and it makes me happy to see her reclaiming her Korean identity too."
JT,"I can speak conversational korean fluently but Im always the butt of the joke bc of my slight accent and lack of knowledge of korean social norms/comedic culture (ex: drinking games, or jokes from GAG concert)"
SR,"Im half (my mom immigrated here from Korea so she is fluent) and I can speak some Korean, and I can read and write. Its hard to hold conversation since my mom mostly spoke in English growing up. I often feel very disconnected because I dont look Korean and am not brave enough to often bring it up, since I dont speak so much of it. I will say my accent is pretty good though"
EP2,"Half Korean. I can read and write but can only comprehend super basic things. I was fluent when I was very little, but my mom stopped teaching me bc she didnt want me to pick up her flawed accent. In hindsight I think flawed Korean would have been better than where I am at now. Struggling with the language has definitely made me feel less Korean, esp. when I can see non-Koreans speak it so much better than me."
JEP,"First off, I love seeing these responses! Its unbelievably comforting to know Im not the only one with strong feelings about my Korean level. Im a 3rd gen and can speak/understand Korean and a semi-conversational level (conversational if its just small talk lol), but pretty lacking overall. Ive always regretted this, but last year I lived in Korea for a year teaching English and felt even more regret that my Korean isnt better. My entire life, Ive felt like Ive been missing out, whether its from not being able to be a part of the Korean group at school or not being able to have meaningful conversations with my grandparents. I always wonder what my life would have been like if I were fluent in both Korean and English, but I try not to dwell on it too much."
HML,"I only speak Good korean when I'm tired or if its to talk to the homies<3 I definitely feel like I don't belong to the korean Identity based on my language skills. I do feel like I belong in it because of culture and my background. I feel like an outcast sometimes. But sometimes I feel like Im in the army strategizing how to live life. My honest thoughts of myself, to ugly to be korean To american to be korean. Yet I still say Im Korean American. Shout out to all the koreaboos that messed me up in highschool<3"
JUH,i feel that sometimes too but u gotta understand thats in our roots so NO ONE can take that from us. Its our identity and in our blood. Plus i feel like even tho we r Korean there r different type like a diaspora kid
SHK,"Full-Korean, raised in Korea for 10 years then immigrated to Australia. I had barely any English tutor for my first few years in Australia and just learnt through listening to friends and reading basic kiddy books. My korean is fluent in conversational level but not academically. If Corona calms down a bit, I was/am planning to go to Korea and study bit of Korean in literature way so I can properly teach to foreigners"
JPP,"Korean mum and dad, was born and raised in the UK. Growing up I used korean in the household so no English allowed (or we were told off). Because Im the first born it took a lot of time for me to learn English because my parents never taught me it and I was too shy to properly learn it at school! So when I was 6 my teacher told my parents I didnt actually know any English, so my mum bless her heart had to teach me English whilst doing her 2nd masters at the same time. Thanks to a scary dad and threats of being beaten my korean is very good with little to no accent. Hated being forced to speak korean and going to korean Saturday school, but now so grateful to my parents I can speak the language and talk to my grandparents and easily identify with my ethnicity and culture! Also watching kdramas and getting into kpop at the age of 13 really helped during puberty and learning more advanced and modern korean! I can watch kmovies and kdramas without subtitles (but I love reading subtitles because Im lazy lol). When I go to Korea people say Im very good at korean and never had any issues with my korean level. But one thing Id like it to be able to speak a bit more advanced korean? So like medical terminology or get to the standard where my English is (which is pretty good as I was a bookworm growing up) but sadly reading korean wasnt really for me so my writing skills are very poor (still hate texting in korean to this day, using the voice note) but then again my reading is good (can follow the really fast readers of the church when reading the bible verses together)"
DW,I dont really speak just reply back in English Its embarrassing when I cant pronounce certain words the correct way I didnt start speaking korean until I was like 4 ish and to this day Im still not fluent I got bullied a lot for not being full and being unable to speak korean without an accent made me feel even worse Im proudly korean and I aim to be fluent one day but I dont know if Ill ever get over the shame I feel when speaking
RC,"was born in korea to korean parents but moved to the US when I was 2 and lived there til I graduated college. growing up, I only learned the absolute basics and could understand my parents well enough but always felt kinda ashamed that I couldn't speak it. right after I graduated, I moved back to South Korea (still here now) and felt suuuuper insecure about how bad my korean was lol but i had taken a course in college and after almost 3 years of living in the motherland, I can say that I'm like 60% fluent - definitely conversational. I'm taking another korean course right now and it's helping me a lot but I think the biggest thing was actually practicing with people and not having people look at me weird for speaking korean"
TK,born and lived in korea for 10 years then came to America. Working to get a green card at the US after having lived here for 15 years. I feel like a foreigner to both sides of the ocean.
VZ,"born in the US but moved to korea shortly after. came back to the US when i was 7. i feel like i Should be better since i did learn and live in the motherland. even back in the states my fam spoke korean around me. so i'm def better at understanding than i am speaking/reading. thing is, i Want to be able to speak even tho i'm not perfect~ at it.... but i'm pretty sure it was like... mildly beaten out of me? for context, when i was a smol child in korea i was sent to a special english school since it was seen as a Hot Thing and a def advantage for your kid. but the school didn't allow you to speak korean or else you got in trouble. and i got in trouble a lot. so, and this is just an unprofessional self reflection here, i have this innate fear to speak my native language? and as an adult, even though i realize it... it's like... hard to get over? idk."
KP,"1.5er here. Born in Korea, immigrated in 1979, 2 months before turning 5, 3 months before kindergarten. My mom taught me to read and write before leaving Korea, and I'd like to think I remembered everything my mom taught me, so my Korean level is perfectly preserved at the 5-year-old level. I grew up in Northern California, and my church had Korean school which was useless to me because I already knew how to read and write at a level higher than what they offered in the 80s, albeit still at the 5-year-old level. My grandmother came from Korea to live with us when I was in 7th grade, by which time I was aware that my Korean was not that good, but thankfully her being in the house kept my Korean in better shape than it otherwise would've been. I certainly felt like I was more Korean than American, partly because my Korean was still better than that of my peers, but also because of the bullies in the 80s who never let me feel American. In college I signed up for a Korean language class, and for the placement interview I was warned by students older than me that I need to fake how bad my Korean was, because you don't want to get placed into an impossibly higher class than you can handle. Because it was for the spring semester, the only class that was available was 1-2, 2-2, or 3-2. I knew 2-2 would be too hard, so I tried to take my way into the 1-2 class. I did well there and learned a ton, but was recommended to take 3-1 next semester. When I had my babies in the mid-2000s, I had made up in my mind that they would speak Korean, so I spoke ONLY Korean to them, knowing that eventually I'd have to switch to English when they're older and their Korean grammar needs become higher than what I can offer them. That shift happened around when they turned 5. Funny thing was, when they were 2 and 4, we went to Korea to visit my in-laws, and all the relatives commented that their Korean was better than mine. Yup, I taught them everything they knew. My husband specifically refused to speak Korean to the kids, much to my disappointment. Because of my limited Korean, I never feel comfortable visiting Korea. My bil and his family lived in the US ever since the 20th century, but recently they moved with their 3 kids to Korea for work. I think I'd be pretty frustrated if I was in his wife's position. Growing up I felt more Korean than American, but when I visited Korea, I felt too American. Funny thing is, when I lived in the Midwest for 7 years, I found out that my true identity is Korean-American Californian. My experience is closer to those growing up in California than anywhere else."
MH,"Lived in Korea until I was 4, moved to NY then moved to Canada when I was 5. My mom spoke to me in korean so that I didnt lose my mother tongue and my dad spoke to me in English. Best of both worlds"
